The structure chosen to solve the problem was to create 3 arrays that represent each of the poles
These arrays will have a length equal to the number of disks included in the simulation
The values included in the arrays are zero for empty spaces and a number for 1 to n-disks representing the disk

This structure will allow us to track all the changes that occur step by step in each of the poles
and identify "illegal movements".

The array structure was chosen because it allows multiple integer values to be stored. 
It also has a fixed length, preventing bugs in the software (they cant store more disks than the ones initiated)
The array structure also makes the graphical representation of the disks easier, as we can keep track of each of the required steps to solve the tower of Hanoi
